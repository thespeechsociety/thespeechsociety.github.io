                    Speaking: The only action which never stops and is used
                      throughout our lives. We hear, react, respond, and talk,
                      and no one hesitates to express themselves. Some people
                      are introverts while some are extroverts. Extroverts are
                      the people who influence the public through their speaking
                      and thoughts. It is a medium to make a change in the
                      thinking of society, and in the lifestyle of the people.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Lakhs and crores of students graduate every year and due to
                    fewer job opportunities, lack of communication and public
                    speaking skills throw them out of the race. Every graduate
                    might have the same level of professional skill, they might
                    all qualify but fail in their communication skills, and here
                    is the reason for the birth of “TSS- THE SPEECH SOCIETY”.
                    Alok Agrawal (Founder) realized the loss borne by the
                    students of the University of Engineering and Management,
                    Jaipur. The idea of “The Speech Society” was first thought
                    of by Alok when he found that there were only five
                    Clubs/Groups in UEMJ, namely: Photography, Nature, Coding,
                    Cultural, and Gaming. There was no existence of a club to
                    hone one’s speaking skills. However, he had the dream of
                    joining a speech community in college. This was when the
                    footing of such an idea started taking place. He contacted
                    some students and discussed the plan for a speech society.
                    This was the point where TSS got its Co-founder Somen
                    Halder. From that day, the journey of TSS started. At that
                    time, 4-5 members, including the founder and co-founder,
                    reached out to the HOD (English) and proposed the idea of
                    starting a communication club, and with the decision in
                    favour of TSS, Dr. Mukesh Yadav was appointed as faculty
                    coordinator whose ideology and suggestions helped to make
                    the idea of a speech society into ‘The Speech Society’. In
                    early Nov 2022, the idea of TSS started taking shape and Web
                    developers, Event managers, Content creators, Photographers,
                    speakers, and many more members, the best from 1st year,
                    were joined who helped Alok to change his dream into a
                    reality. They all worked together and discussed the working
                    model of TSS. After much deliberation, it was decided that
                    TSS would cover and organize events such as Debates,
                    Speeches/Elocutions, Chai Pe Charcha, Quizzes, Poetry,
                    Language, Anchoring, Live Podcast, Interview Preparation,
                    Spell Bee, Story Telling and many more. It was now time to
                    give TSS official recognition. The members were working with
                    the belief that the more you heat a clay pot, the stronger
                    it gets. Every member worked hard and spent sleepless nights
                    making it happen.

                  <h3>Milestone 1:</h3>
                  <p>
                    Getting the official approval to form the society. The
                    Registrar signed and registered TSS under the Society Act on
                    8th Nov 2022, giving it a new identity.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Milestone 2:</h3>
                  <p>
                    On 14th Nov 2022, prof. (Dr.) Anirudh Mukherjee,
                    Dean(Academics), signed the proposal draft and showed a
                    green flag to make ‘THE SPEECH SOCIETY’ an official body at
                    UEMJ.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Milestone 3:</h3>
                  <p>
                    TSS was now ready to launch. The inauguration event was to
                    be held in the same month but examinations and practicals
                    became the hurdle in the path of the grand opening. In a
                    race, athletes take a few steps back to make a great start,
                    not to leave. With this thinking, UEMJ’s athlete - “TSS” was
                    taking steps back to setbacks but only to come back with
                    more energy and ideas.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Milestone 4:</h3>
                  <p>
                    The first, but unofficial event by TSS was organized on 11th
                    Nov 2022 with the students from the BPT department which was
                    a successful demo of TSS and it was highly appreciated.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Milestone 5:</h3>
                  <p>
                    After a long wait and much preparation, finally the clock
                    clicked the hour when the official inauguration date was
                    finalised and on 19th Jan 2023. Prof. (Dr.) Biswajoy
                    Chatterjee (Vice Chancellor) and the Registrar permitted and
                    sanctioned the budget for the inauguration event: “AARAMBH”.
                    The dream of an official Inauguration came true on 02nd Feb
                    2023. The renowned influencer - Mr. Kuldeep Singhania was
                    invited as Chief Guest to inaugurate THE SPEECH SOCIETY.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Milestone 6:</h3>
                  <p>
                    The first official meeting of selected TSS members with the
                    Vice Chancellor was held on 8th Feb 2023 where he
                    appreciated the Founder and members for their hard work and
                    a grand inauguration event that was managed successfully.
                  </p>
